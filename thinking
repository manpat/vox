Block OnInteract should recieve info about interacter
	Should enable synchronisation over network

ComputerBlock -> Computer
Computer -> ComputerBlock // to change tint/textures or some shit
Computer -> ComputerGUI
Computer -> vm state and port states


Need GUI helpers to make shit not terrible
	buttons n' stuff
	info about gui things
	centralised way to get focus

ComputerGUI : Overlay

Computer : ThingWithPorts

ThingWithPortsManager {
	ThingWithPorts[] things;
}

ThingWithPorts {
	type // id into ThingsWithPortsRegistry

	PortIn[] inputs
	PortOut[] outputs
}

// How ports work kinda depends on what style language the computers will have

// Input ports can accept input from one source
// Output ports can output to many input ports

Port {
	enum Type {
		boolean, // Controlling lights n' shit; button input
		number, // Maybe split into int/float? Maybe not? Controlling thrusters
		string,

		composite/bus, // Bundles of data; port forwarders, connecting monitors/computers
		// Just pointer to thing? {Address/Port, Value} packets?
	}

	string name
}

PortIn : Port {
	Connection to PortOut

	Value GetValue() // pull value from connection or use default (sticky?)
}

PortOut : Port {
	Connection to PortIn []

	void SetValue(Value)
}
