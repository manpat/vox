Figure out what the game is
	Ship building?
	Base building?

	Resources?
		Fuel?
		Power?
			Solar - requires lots of space
			Nuclear - Can explode
		Air?
			Hard to pull off well

	"Beam me up scotty"

Render system
	Needs to render voxels

	Deferred rendering?
		If so, needs way to manage framebuffers and rendering to them

		Means we can have a fucktonne of point lights relatively cheaply

	Text rendering
	Particles?

	How to manage buffer objects?

	HUD
		Aim helper - highlight hovered block somehow

Rewrite a bunch of physics stuff
	Generate colliders for voxels

Computers?
	Need text input/rendering
	interpreter
		What style?
		High level? Lua
		Low level? ASM
			Kinda cool but restrictive in what computers can do wrt ease

	Ideas
		(holo) Displays
		Bleep bloop
		Flashy lights

	What do they do? How do they interact with env?
		Control ship systems
			thrust, shields, pew guns, "beam me up scotty"
			air locks/doors
			"Punch it chewie"
			monitor ship stuff
			make cool holo ui stuff

Multiplayer?
	Hard but super cool

	How do synchronise things
		Object transforms
		Voxel updates

	Requires prediction for high-ish latency connections
		i.e. most connections
