Figure out what the game is
	Ship building
	Base building

	Resources?
		Fuel?
		Power?
			Solar - requires lots of space
			Nuclear - Can explode
		Materials for building?
		Air?
			Hard to pull off well

	"Beam me up scotty"

	Team vs team
		Would need to be balanced such that using computers is viable
			Too much pressure (e.g. time limits, fast path to mass destruction) means
			time spent on computers looses value

		Teams spawn in separate sections of large map, unknown to each other
		Require warp drives or something to traverse map
			High cost warp drives make computers more viable

Render system
	Needs to render voxels

	Deferred rendering?
		If so, needs way to manage framebuffers and rendering to them

		Means we can have a fucktonne of point lights relatively cheaply

	Text rendering
	Particles?

	How to manage buffer objects?

	HUD
		Aim helper - highlight hovered block somehow

Rewrite a bunch of physics stuff
	Generate colliders for voxels

Computers?
	Need text input/rendering
	interpreter
		What style?
		High level? Lua
			More accessible. Probably better given time constraints
		Low level? ASM
			Kinda cool but restrictive in what computers can do wrt ease

	Ideas
		(holo) Displays
		Bleep bloop
		Flashy lights
		Touch screens

	What do they do? How do they interact with env?
		Control ship systems
			thrust, shields, pew guns, "beam me up scotty"
			air locks/doors
			"Punch it chewie"
			monitor ship stuff
			make cool holo ui stuff

Multiplayer?
	Hard but super cool

	How do synchronise things
		Serialization
		Object transforms
		Voxel updates

	Requires prediction for high-ish latency connections
		i.e. most connections
